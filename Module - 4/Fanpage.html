<h2>Bio</h2>




<br>

<h3>Rise to Success to Critical Acclaim</h3>

<p>Radiohead are an English band who formed in 1985. In 1992, they released their debut album "Pablo Honey." Lead single "Creep" would jettison the British Alt-Rockers to stardom seemingly
overnight. This anthem is still to this day their most popular song, and is played at some shows almost 30 years since it's release despite the band's less than fond
opinion of it. Elsewhere throughout the album, there are some bright spots such as opener "You" and closer "Blow Out." However, Pablo Honey is generally considered to 
be the weakest of the band's discography by fans and critics alike. 

<br>
<br>

Dubbed as a "one-hit-wonder" by many critics, Radiohead erased this notion with their follow-up album "The Bends." With songs like "Planet Telex, Fake Plastic Trees,
Street Spirit," Radiohead began the process of sculpting their own unique sound, and featured a more mature song-writting approach than it's predecessor. Also of note,
longtime Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich worked as an engineer on The Bends, and produced the song "Black Star." Godrich would later go on to produce each subsequent
Radiohead album. 

<br>
<br>

Following the release of the Bends and non-stop world touring, Radiohead would continue straight on the same path they had been on since "Creep," and go onto record "Ok Computer" 
To this day, Ok Computer is widely regarded as one of the greatest all-time albums, and it did not come easily as evidenced in the documentary "Meeting People Is Easy." Radiohead had been 
recording and touring non-stop, and it resulted in a near break-up of the band. However, they would persevere to create a masterpiece, featuring classics like "Paranoid Android, Let Down, 
Karma Police, No Surprises, and Lucky." The albums lyrics and futuristic guitar tones encapsulated the dystopian paranoia of the digital age foreseen by frontman Yorke. 

<br>
<br>

<h3>Early 2000s Dramatic Sound Shift</h3>


Radiohead would go on to take a break following the enormous success of Ok Computer. 3 years later (2000), Radiohead kickstarted the 21st century with "Kid A," a highly experimental album 
that saw the band putting the guitars down in favor of electronics, drum machines vocal experimentations, string arangements, and trancendent soundscapes. 
Kid A is the #1 album of the 2000s per Rollingstone, and is commonly referred to as one of Radiohead's greatest achievements. Artists spanning multiple genres have cited Kid A as an 
inspiration, particularly in the rap/hip-hop genre, due to it's subtle and contemporary soundscapes evidenced in "Everything In It's Right Place, Kid A, How to Disappear Completely, and 
Idioteque."

<br>
<br>


Kid A was followed less than a year later by "Amnesiac," which some critics say delved even more into experimentation than it's predecessor. From the Egyptian chord chord progression and
haunting melody of "Pyramid Song," to the backwards recorded vocals that were reversed in the studio to the unsettling "Like Spinning Plates", Radiohead proved resiliant in carving out any type of 
experimental processes they could find.

<br>
<br>

With America's wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, Radiohead would go on to relesase their most political album, "Hail to the Thief," in 2003. This would also be Radiohead's longest album to date.
The album kicks off with 2+2=5, which off the bat pleased fans who had yearned for a return to their distortion pedals and dramatic rock dynamics. Hail to the Thief
was recorded in Los Angeles, and consists of mostly live takes, a change in pace from Kid A/Amnesiac, and sought to combime their rock/electonic sounds.


<br>
<br>


<h3>Pay What You Want</h3>

Following the end of their contract with record label EMI with Hail to the Thief, the band took a hiatus. This provided them the opportunity to be with their families,
and also work on various projects, including Thom Yorke's first solo album (The Eraser), and film scores from Jonny Greenwood (Bodysong and There Will Be Blood). In 
2005, the band began recording new material, and enlisted producer Spike Stent to help produce it. However, these sessions didn't go anywhere, and there was frustration
within the band. The band decided to tour and try their new material live, which proved to be beneficial. Following the success of these shows, Radiohead re-enlisted 
producer Nigel Godrich, and ultimately captured what turned out to be one of their most accessable and critically acclaimed albums to date, In Rainbows. The album
was self-released in October of 2007, and experimented with allowing buyers to pay-what-you-want for the album. Beyond the marketing, saw the band perfect their sound 
with themes of love, fear, and death. Musically, the band is firing on all clylinders with the asymetric yet dancey meter in "15 5tep," raw and upbeat "Bodysnatchers,"
triple guitar polyrhythmic arpeggios in "Weird Fishes," and trancendent climaxes in "Nude," "All I Need," "Reckoner."

<h3>2010s And Into the Present</h3>

The King of Limbs was announced on Valentines Day 2011, and would be released 4 days later on February 18th, 2011. According to Jonny Greenwood, the band did not want
to go into the studio and record in a standard band format, and they also did not want to endlessly tinker with electronics. They strived for a new method they had not yet tried 
that encompassed both. Thom and producer Nigel were experimenting with DJing, and this led Jonny Greenwood to create a looping software, that would take snippits of
band performances and allow them to be looped and edited. It was a two week experiment that turned into 6 months, that turned into The King of Limbs. Radiohead released
the lead single "Lotus Flower" the day before the album came out, and features a catchy drum groove with intricate synchopation, and a prominent bass groove from Colin
Greenwood. The guitars in this album are there, but are so subtle that sometimes they can barely be heard. Rather, this album focuses on the driving basslines and percussion
from Colin and Phil. In order to perform these songs live, Radiohead enlisted Clive Deemer of Portishead so serve as a second drummer. He is still with the band today.

<br>
<br>

On May 1, 2016, Radiohead teased their fans by erasing their social medias to complete white images. Two days later, Radiohead released a stop-motion video for their
first single "Burn the Witch," followed by Paul Thomas Anderson's masterful directing of the video for "Daydreaming." 
The album was officially released on May 8, 2016, and is highly critically acclaimed. Lyrically, A Moon Shaped Pool is regarded as one of the saddest and most 
heartbreaking of Radiohead's records evidenced in songs like "Daydreaming,""Decks Dark," and "Glass Eyes," which are likely attributed to Thom Yorke's lifelong partner,
Rachel Owen's passing to cancer. Jonny Greenwood's string arrangements performed by the London contemporary Orchestra are prominent throughout. 
Electronics are minimal as this is mostly an acoustic and orchestrated album, but there are filters applied to instruments throughout.

<br>
<br>

Radiohead are currently taking a break after touring A Moon Shaped Pool for 3 years. Thom Yorke recently released his first score for the film "Suspiria." Jonny Greenwood
released his vinyl for the score he made for "Phantom Thread," which was nominated for Best Original Score in the 2018 Academy Awards. Phil Selway and Ed O'Brien each 
are rumored to be working on new albums, and remains a strong chance that the band will reunite in the hopefully not-too-distant future.
